# Car Evaluation Prediction (Naive Bayes + Flask)

This project is a **web-based machine learning application** that predicts the **acceptability of a car** based on six categorical features such as buying price, maintenance cost, number of doors, passenger capacity, luggage boot size, and safety. It uses a **Categorical Naive Bayes** model trained on the **Car Evaluation dataset** from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

The model classifies cars into one of four categories:  
- **unacc** â†’ Unacceptable  
- **acc** â†’ Acceptable  
- **good** â†’ Good  
- **vgood** â†’ Very Good

## ðŸ”¹ Features
- Categorical Naive Bayes classifier
- Simple web interface with dropdown menus for all features
- Instant prediction of car acceptability
- Data-driven model trained on UCI Car Evaluation dataset

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
- **Source:** [UCI Machine Learning Repository â€“ Car Evaluation Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/car+evaluation)
- **Instances:** 1,728
- **Features:**  
  1. Buying Price (`vhigh`, `high`, `med`, `low`)  
  2. Maintenance Cost (`vhigh`, `high`, `med`, `low`)  
  3. Number of Doors (`2`, `3`, `4`, `5more`)  
  4. Persons Capacity (`2`, `4`, `more`)  
  5. Luggage Boot Size (`small`, `med`, `big`)  
  6. Safety Level (`low`, `med`, `high`)  
- **Target Classes:** `unacc`, `acc`, `good`, `vgood`

---

## ðŸ–¥ Prediction Output
The app predicts one of:
- **unacc** â€“ Unacceptable  
- **acc** â€“ Acceptable  
- **good** â€“ Good  
- **vgood** â€“ Very Good
