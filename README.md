# Naive-Bayes
Naive Bayes is a fast and simple probabilistic classifier based on Bayesâ€™ theorem, assuming features are independent given the class. It calculates class probabilities from feature likelihoods and priors, choosing the highest. Effective for tasks like spam filtering and text classification, even with limited data.
